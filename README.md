# Weapon-Reassembler
A mod for tinkering with boomsticks in Starbound. Does not change the stats. Or does it?..

Known limitations:
- Can not combine certain altModes with physical damage (namely, Energy Lance and Explosive Burst). This option should be locked with internal checks.

## THANKS
C0bra5 - for his useful Recolor Tool (http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/update-v1-1-2-recolor-maker-2.105981/)


## TODO:

- [DONE!] Option to copy single weapon part visuals
- [DONE!] Compatible common/uncommon/rare weapons
- [DONE!] Optional sound replication
- [DONE!] Changing weapon's alt mode
- [BONUS DONE!] Now with 100% more feedback on errors
- [PARTIALLY DONE] Weapon reassemble preview
- [TESTING] Changing weapon element
- Element: try to implement common gun elements and uncommon gun "physical" element
- Element: implement UI locks for unavailable combinations
- Informative UI
- Recoloring weapon from scratch (dye punk, can you use it?)
- Applying reassembly resource costs
- Support for melee weapons
- Changing weapon projectile type (for grenade launchers etc) (will cost resources)
- Weapon altMode descriptions (inside the station? Icons? Book?)
- Maybe: scanning a weapon to "remember" appearance (with no need for a template later)
- Upgrading weapon stats (will cost resources, will be limited - you won't be able to use a low-tier gun through the entire game)
- lulz
