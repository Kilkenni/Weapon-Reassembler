# Weapon-Reassembler
A mod for tinkering with boomsticks in Starbound. Does not change the stats. Or does it?..

Known limitations:
- Can not combine certain altModes with physical damage (namely, Energy Lance and Explosive Burst). It can't be avoided since these altModes are locked to appropriate elements, and changing them will create too much incompatibilities. To avoid any problems this combination should be locked by default with my internal checks.
- Common-rarity guns can't change primary fire element, normal fire always stays "physical". Again, this is a limitation on Starbound's side where common-rarity weapons are STRICTLY "physical" and weapons of higher rarity are STRICTLY elemental. altMode element changes, however, are ok.

## THANKS
C0bra5 - for his useful Recolor Tool (http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/update-v1-1-2-recolor-maker-2.105981/)

It would take me ages to create palettes without it.

C0rdyc3p5 - for his friendly SMK, the StarModder's Kit (http://community.playstarbound.com/threads/starmodder-kit-the-modding-ide-wip.117686/)

I usually use it for packing/unpacking my .pak files.

## TODO:

- [DONE] Option to copy single weapon part visuals
- [DONE] Compatible common/uncommon/rare weapons
- [DONE] Optional sound replication
- [DONE] Changing weapon's alt mode
- [BONUS] Now with 100% more feedback on errors
- [PARTIALLY DONE] Weapon reassemble preview
- [DONE] Changing weapon element
- [TOO MUCH HASSLE] Element: try to implement common gun elements and uncommon gun "physical" element
- [DONE] Element: implement UI locks for unavailable combinations
- Fix barrel button to be more recognizeable
- Change checkboxes for sound and altMode
- Add sound changes when changing element (automatic or keep it manual as it is now?)
- Informative UI
- [TESTING] Recoloring weapon from scratch (dye punk, can you use it?)
- Palettes for every dye, more palettes, palettes!
- [DONE] Do nothing with the weapon if no options are selected
- Applying reassembly resource costs
- Support for melee weapons
- Changing weapon projectile type (for grenade launchers etc) (will cost resources)
- Weapon altMode descriptions (inside the station? Icons? Book?)
- [DECLINED] Maybe: scanning a weapon to "remember" appearance (with no need for a template later)
- Upgrading weapon stats (will cost resources, will be limited - you won't be able to use a low-tier gun through the entire game)
- lulz
