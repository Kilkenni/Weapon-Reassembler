# Weapon-Reassembler
A mod for tinkering with boomsticks in Starbound. Does not change the stats. Or does it?..

## TODO:

- Option to copy colors from the template
- Option to copy single weapon part visuals
- [DONE!] Compatible common/uncommon/rare weapons
- [DONE!] Optional sound replication
- Random generated melee weapons
- Informative UI
- Weapon reassemble preview
- Recoloring weapon from scratch (dye punk, can you use it?)
- Applying reassembly resource costs
- Maybe: scanning a weapon to "remember" appearance (with no need for a template later)
- Changing weapon element (will cost resources)
- [NO COST] Changing weapon's alt mode (will cost resources & probably destroy the template)
- Upgrading weapon stats (will cost resources, will be limited - you won't be able to use a low-tier gun through the entire game)
- lulz
